## React Material Tile

ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress, components are subject to change. 

React Material Tile components were created to make Material Grid layouts easier. 
These components were designed for use with [React Material UI](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui),
but they also work well by themselves with a few adjustments.

### NPM
```
npm install --save react-material-tile
```
### Components

#### MaterialTile
Displays an image, which transforms into a React Material UI card on click. Tile / card behavior is handled by default.

##### Usage
```
import MaterialTile from "react-material-tile"
...

	<MaterialTile src={ image.png }
		      title="React Tile Card"
		      noImageInHeader 	// don't show image in card header
		      tileWidth="250px"
		      tileHeight="250px"
		      zDepth={ 0 } 	// pass in Material UI props to card
		      cardStyle={{ border: "1px solid black" }}>
		<CardText>
			Content here
		</CardText>
	</MaterialTile>
```

#### MaterialTileRouted
ðŸš§ This component is in progress and is not currently distributed as part of this package. Allows you to use your uri to determine open / closed state of tiles. It checks the 
url for a component's name and wheither or not it is active, it also works with nested tiles.


### Use with React Material UI or with a custom theme
Theming is optional, however, if you do decide to use a theme,
you can pass it to all Material Tile components by using the
ThemeProvider supplied by Styled components.

```
import React, { Component } from "react"
import MuiThemeProvider from "material-ui/styles/MuiThemeProvider"
import getMuiTheme from "material-ui/styles/getMuiTheme"
import lightBaseTheme from "material-ui/styles/baseThemes/lightBaseTheme"
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components"

export class App extends Component {

	render() {
	    return <MuiThemeProvider muiTheme={ getMuiTheme(lightBaseTheme) }>
		     <ThemeProvider theme={ lightBaseTheme }>
		     	...
		     </ThemeProvider>	     
		   </MuiThemeProvider>
       }
}	     
```
### Use without React Material UI
ðŸš§ documentation: in progress  
To use MaterialTile components without React Material UI, you would
just need to supply your own custom Card to MaterialTile or MaterialTileFunctional.
